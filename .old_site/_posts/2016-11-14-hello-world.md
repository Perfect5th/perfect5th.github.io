Time to start experimenting with Jekyll!

Not a lot going on at the moment, it seems, but you've probably already guessed
that. I've already refreshed my Rails knowledge and have been helping my old
friend/roommate with some of his work down at the old bootcamp.

He's killing it, to say the least, and I haven't really helped him all that
much, minus some minor debugging and moral support. Only a couple of weeks left,
and I'm not worried about him at all.

I still need to buff up the look of this site a bit. If you are at all curious,
the domain is registered with AWS and the site is a simple
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) blog hosted on
[Github pages](https://pages.github.com/). If you're interested in doing
something like this for yourself, shoot me an email (address in the footer) or
take a solid glance at this site's
[repo](https://github.com/Perfect5th/perfect5th.github.io).

Keep on learning
