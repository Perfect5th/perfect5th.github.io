title: Heavy Visualizer

My good friend [Mario](https://tendermario.github.io/) (he's the guy I mentioned
in my first-ever blog post) has completed the
[Lighthouse Labs](https://www.lighthouselabs.ca/) Web Dev Bootcamp. His final
project, [Heavy Visualizer](http://heavyvisualizer.com/), does a fantastic job
of displaying both his Javascript technical prowess and his masterful mathematic
mind.

Give it a spin: drag and drop an audio file (mp3/wav), project it in fullscreen
on a blank wall, and throw yourself a mini-rave.

Also Mario-related – he's looking for a job! If you think you've got what it
takes to interview this bad-boy for a position, take a look at his
[developer site](https://tendermario.github.io/) and drop him a line.

The sooner he gets a job, the sooner he can move out of our second bedroom, so
it's a win-win-win (your win is the third one).

I just finished reading another novel, and I'm crunching my way through Humble
Bundle's
[Unix Book Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books/unix-book-bundle). There's
only a few days left to grab that one, so hurry hard. You'll probably hear from
me soon regarding what I've picked up from *Classic Shell Scripting*.
