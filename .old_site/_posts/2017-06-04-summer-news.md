Well, I was admitted to UBC's Bachelor's of Computer Science as a 2nd degree. It will 20 months
straight of full-time schoolin'. I'm looking forward to the change of pace, and hopefully it won't
be so time-consuming that I won't be able to work on a few things on the side, whether or not they
be for money.

I've just come down with a wicked cold, so I'll try to keep things relatively short in this one.

I need to get on making the design of this site more responsive. It occurs to me that a lot of
the many, many (imaginary) visitors are probably visiting on mobile. And, while the mobile layout
is _pretty_ nice, it ain't perfect. Could use some tweaking. We shall see.

I'm also looking at some CSS naming methodology, just to keep things organized.
[BEM](http://getbem.com/) looks like a fairly simple one, so I'll try it out and if I hate it, I
will stop trying it out.

Enjoy the summer weather!
