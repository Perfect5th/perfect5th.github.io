  <h2>404! Oh no!</h2>
  <p>
    I admire your bravery, plunging into the unknown, looking for pages that
    you&rsquo;ve only heard of in legends and ancient songs, but you seem to
    have misstepped.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let&rsquo;s try again from square one: pick one of the incredibly well
    thought-out and lovingly handcrafted options on the right here &#8594; (or top, on
    mobile).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you could&rsquo;ve sworn that there was actually a page at this location
    and you&rsquo;d prefer to challenge me to a duel for pulling the carpet out
    from under you, send me an email, and we&rsquo;ll straighten this out with
    the weapons of your choice at the relative sun positioning of your choosing
    (both weapons must be the same, none of this knife-to-a-gun-fight stuff).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you&rsquo;re friendlier than that, and something you wanted to find
    actually <em>has</em> gone missing. I&rsquo;m deeply sorry, but I
    don&rsquo;t have time to cater to your every whim, so the phrase
    &ldquo;deal with it&rdquo; comes to mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you&rsquo;re my wife, the above paragraphs are not applicable and I will
    fix this immediately, I&rsquo;m <em>so</em> sorry.
