title: Siddhartha

So, I recently finished [Siddhartha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_%28novel%29)
by Hermann Hesse. Best [single Canadian dollar](http://a.co/6t49Ryb) I've ever
spent on an e-book.

The premise is simple — young, headstrong, maybe with a bit of a superiority
complex soon-to-be priest heads off into the world in search of enlightenment.

Spoiler: he finds enlightenment... eventually.

But his final realization is not an easy one, and depends upon all his life
experiences, the good and the bad, to manifest.

Siddhartha's rejection of "teachings" is a thread that runs through the story.
Even when meeting Buddha himself, Siddhartha respects his teachings and their
approach to reduce suffering, but concludes that they do not contain what is
truly needed to achieve enlightenment — the sum of experiences that contributed
to Buddha's Ultimate Realization.

I highly recommend Siddhartha, and I'm surprised that I hadn't read it until
now. It only took a few hours to read. My only criticism is that the Kindle
version I bought seemed to have some translation errors, but they didn't obscure
any meaning and were pretty ignorable.
