title: Learning C, Maybe?
---
For awhile now, I've been concerned that I'm lacking some more _primal_
knowledge. I've never worked in C or C++, and have only a passing familiarity
with the family. Had I gone through any sort of formal Comp Sci program, I'm
sure I would have had more exposure to them than I currently do.

I've been toying with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for a bit now, and
that's all well and good, as far as safe, compiled languages go, but Rust is
neither historical or particularly widespread.

To this end, I've picked up a copy of the classic
[K&R Bible, Second Edition](http://a.co/1bmSmG0). Am I making a mistake here?
Is C knowledge even necessary, or relevant? I'm of the opinion that any
knowledge is good knowledge, but if you think this is a waste of time, let me
know in the comments.*

what you think, and I do want to hear from you there's always
