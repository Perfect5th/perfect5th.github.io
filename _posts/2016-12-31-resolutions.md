As 2016 comes to a close, I'm not really sure how to feel. This year has been
bittersweet, for me, and very eventful, politically.

I refuse to discuss politics here, though, so let's focus on me.

Back at the end of August (it might have been early September) I made a big
decision — I gave up on my "dream" of going to medical school.
I've scared-quoted "dream" because I hadn't been excited about it in over a
couple of years. The application process and the waiting had become tedious,
and the end goal was muddied, not as interesting as it used to be to me.

Essentially, the scales had tipped. My imagined future had been informed too
much by reality, until its benefit was outweighed by the efforts and cost. I
could explain further, but all I really want to say is that I didn't feel either
passion or progress, anymore.

So I didn't submit any medical applications this year. Instead, I submitted an
application for a two-year Bachelor's of Computer Science, starting September
2017 and going 20 months straight. I'm still not wholly convinced that this is
the *best* decision, or even the right step to be taking, but it's picked me up
off of my ass and given me some direction. Wish me luck.

### My Current Situation

I will be working at my current job until I go back to school in September. If
you are someone I work with, and this is the first you've heard of this, I
apologize that I forgot to tell you.

I still want to add comments to this site, and I've been tooling around with
the idea of Facebook comments or Disqus or something of the like. None of the
options I've looked at have satisfied me, so I guess I'll try building my own.

2017 should be fun. My New Year's Resolution? Stop titling posts as questions.
