Holy, it's been awhile! Over 5 months since my last post on here. I feel like
I've failed to keep some promise to myself, but it's not like anyone is really
reading this, _right_?

I've done a crazy complete overhaul of this site, and it's still in progress, so
stay tuned! I've got some plans that are sure to punch it up.

- Ability to switch colour palettes on the fly.
- Links to more of my projects/work.
- An actual link to my github somewhere.
- An enormous photo gallery of my cats.

Yay, long weekend!

Maybe I'll even get around to ordering business cards one of these days...
