title: The Advent of Go
---
Hello, thronging hordes of people who are almost certainly not reading this!

I've started working with Go, and, while I am working on a project _in_ Go,
that's not what I'm Go-ing to be talking about (I'm not sorry).

There's a lot of ways to learn something, but I favour interesting challenges
rather than writing another _goddamn_ to-do app. Luckily, this is the most
wonderful time of the year, by which I mean it's time for [The Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com)!

The AoC is pretty self-explanatory – each day (at 9 PM Pacific time) there's a
new two-part puzzle released. Competitors are ranked based on how quickly they
complete the puzzles, with the top 100 earning useless, incredible points! You
can also compete with your (completely real) friends in a private leaderboard,
which has a few different choices as to how they are scored.

In the interest of earning those _sweet, sweet_ points, I'll be doing every
puzzle first in Python, to try to be quick, then following up with a solution in
Go. I also plan on timing my solutions in each language, just out of
self-interest (I stole this idea from a friend). Maybe I'll even put a page on
here highlighting my results.

Here are my results for the first part of Day 1:
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Language</th>
    <th>Benchmark</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Python v3.6.3</td>
      <td>1.0989 ms</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Go v1.9.2</td>
      <td>0.0541 ms</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
