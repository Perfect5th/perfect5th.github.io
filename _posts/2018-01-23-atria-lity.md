A couple of my personal projects have fallen by the wayside over time, and I
keep promising myself that I'm going to get back to them, but it becomes pretty
difficult. I'm going to be making an effort to cut out a few extracurriculars to
make room for the work and projects that I'm really excited about – we'll see
how that pans out!

This will be a pretty short post, but here's something I _am_ excited about!

#### Atria

Not sure if I've mentioned it before, but a good friend of mine is one of the
founders of a local co-operative organization called
[the Atria Technologies Co-op](https://www.atria.coop/). Atria has the
(admittedly) lofty goal of alleviating poverty, and although that's pretty
ambitious, I'm always interested in cool projects (and gaining experience), so
I've signed on as a developer for Atria in my spare time.

The project is only just getting off the ground, but I'm working with some
pretty neat people, and I'll get to flex both my instructional muscles and the
ones that I use for writing code and such.

#### Work in Progress Wiki

On Christmas eve day (Dec 24th) I read
[an article](https://hackernoon.com/why-i-created-my-own-wiki-c41b670250d2)
about the benefits of having your own wiki/knowledge base. I figured the minimal
amount of work to get a wiki going was certainly worth the possible gains, and
so [Work in Progress](http://wiki.mitchellburton.ca) was born!

Obviously this is a work-in-progress, so things are pretty mild right now. It's
running on the free tier of Heroku, so it has some inherent limitations. Still,
for something I got running (thanks to
[django-wiki](https://github.com/django-wiki/django-wiki/)) in a couple of hours,
I could't be happier!

Ciao for now!
