So, I've redesigned the site again, but I had more of a plan of action this
time, and I think it's probably going to stay this way for awhile.

The new colour palette is inspired by the album cover of Booker Ervin's
["HEAVY!!!"](http://a.co/j6jOn3g), though I've inverted the colours and adjusted
them a little bit. Check out the album – if you like sax blues, I'm sure you'll
enjoy it.

Most of the development time for this update went into creating the animations
on the homepage, and I'm not done with them yet! I learned a bunch about
animating SVGs, and I still have a backlog of improvements that I would like to
make.

On this list is:
  * animations of the three images in the middle of the page that are `onclick`
  * using [CSS Grid](
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) for the
    blog and projects index pages.
  * an "about me" section that maybe actually has a photo of me, who knows.
  * add more technologies to that section of the homepage – maybe break it down
    a bit into platforms, as having it just broken down by language can be
    underwhelming.

Onward!
