I'm a Vancouver-based web developer and clinical researcher, currently working for Biolux Research Ltd. on their flagship product [OrthoPulse<sup>Â®</sup>](http://orthopulse.com) and its associated mobile app backend, web app, and online store. I also do statistical analysis as part of Biolux's ongoing clinical research efforts.

Most of my work is done in Python (both 2 and 3), [Django](http://djangoproject.com), or [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org), but I'm also familiar with [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [JQuery](http://jquery.com), [Rust](http://rust-lang.org), and raw SQL.

You can find me (sometimes) on twitter at:
