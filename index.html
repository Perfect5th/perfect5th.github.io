  <h2>Web Design and Development &ndash; Minty Fresh</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Mitch Burton, and I make things on and for the web.</p>
  <p>
    This site is a place where I can experiment, blog, and occasionally break things.
    My number one favourite thing to do is challenge myself to learn new things,
    so if you have an interesting project in mind,
    <em>please let me know about it</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    If something on here looks like hot garbage, or you just want to ask me
    something that won&rsquo;t irreparably damage my self-esteem, you can contact
    me at <a class="external" href="mailto:mitch@mitchellburton.ca">mitch@mitchellburton.ca</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to sign me up for as many spam mailing lists as you like, I can
    take it. If you like the design of the site, let me know!

  <h2>What I Do, Specifically Speaking</h2>
  <p>
    Oh, someone actually read this far? In that case, I&rsquo;ll tell you in a
    bit more detail what I do.
  </p>

  <h3>Web Apps</h3>
  <p>
    My current full-time job is as a web app developer! I make stuff that does
    stuff. Neat stuff! Trust me!
  </p>
  <p>
    I&rsquo;m a full-stack web developer at Biolux Research, Ltd. in Vancouver,
    BC. This includes developing and maintaining a web portal, REST API, and
    online store as part of a small team. Being on a small team is great, as it
    lets me experiment with new technologies, and come up with creative
    solutions &ndash; turning my own and others&rsquo; ideas into reality.
  </p>

  <h3>Web Design</h3>
  <p>Design is a newer passion of mine, but I&rsquo;m diving right into it!</p>
  <p>
    As a member of a (very) small development team, having strong design skills
    is an absolute must. While I&rsquo;ll admit that I am not the most
    experienced designer, I pride myself on a nearly fanatical attention to
    detail. I value clean, intuitive design, with an emphasis on consistency and
    reusability of components. Also, I <em>really</em> like green.
  </p>

  <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
  <p>Learning things requires data, and data is one of the things I do best!</p>
  <p>
    With my background in biochemistry, I started my career in a
    research-oriented role. I have a high-level working knowledge of statistical
    analysis, which I do <em>not</em> hesitate to bore people with. Give me a
    big, fat dataset and throw me in a quiet room &ndash; I can&rsquo;t promise
    you&rsquo;ll get the results you want, but statistically-supported
    conclusions are a thing of beauty.
  </p>

  <h3>Technologies I &lt;3</h3>
  <p>
    Here&rsquo;s the rundown on the tech I know and love. This section
    <em>should</em> be constantly expanding. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m probably dead
    &ndash; someone tell my family!
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Python</dt>
    <dd>
      Python is the language that I work in most frequently, as it&rsquo;s the
      main one I use at my day job! I&rsquo;ve listed it first here because
      it&rsquo;s certainly my top competency. I use it for back-end development,
      (mainly Django) statistics, and automating boring tasks &ndash; sorry,
      <em>optimizations</em>.
    </dd>

    <dt>JavaScript</dt>
    <dd>
      JS is where it&rsquo;s at right now, and I get the hype. I love JavaScript
      most when I want to make something quick, like a prototype or a bot that
      automatically responds &ldquo;lol&rdquo; on Slack. I slay with Node in the
      back-end and perform feats of derring-do with React (or Preact!) in the
      front. I also know jQuery, but I wasn&rsquo;t going to mention that
      because I&rsquo;m sure you don&rsquo;t care!
    </dd>

    <dt>R</dt>
    <dd>
      Although most of my stats work nowadays has moved to Python, I still have
      a soft spot for R. When I need to do some quick hypothesis testing or gen
      a sassy multilevel regression, I&rsquo;ll often dust off the ol&rsquo; R
      shell.
    </dd>

    <dt>SQL</dt>
    <dd>
      I know enough SQL to avoid stabbing myself in the eye with a tricky
      <code>JOIN</code> or subquery contstruct, but <em>please</em> don&rsquo;t
      ask me to write your sprocs (at least, not yet). My preference is
      PostGres, and I&rsquo;ll also use this space to mention that I&rsquo;ve
      done some work with mongo, but I&rsquo;m a novice at best. Isn&rsquo;t
      this honesty <em>refreshing?</em>
    </dd>

    <dt>HTML &amp; CSS</dt>
    <dd>
      I know both of these, yay! I&rsquo;m a fan of Sass, and will use literally
      whatever template engine I can get my hands on.
    </dd>

    <dt><em>Others?</em></dt>
    <dd>
      I&rsquo;m always working on learning something! Right now, those
      somethings are <strong>C</strong>, <strong>Rust</strong>, and maybe
      <strong>Go</strong>. If I feel I&rsquo;ve learned something well enough,
      I&rsquo;ll move it up to the list above.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p>Since you&rsquo;ve made it this far, let me let you in on a little secret:</p>
  <p><em>I love writing documentation.</em></p>
  <p>Do with this knowledge what you will.</p>

  <h4>&mdash; Mitch</h4>
