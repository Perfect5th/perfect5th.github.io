So things have changed a little bit. This should be brief:

1. My current employer made me an offer I couldn't refuse, so I'm deferring my university re-enrolment until September 2018. I think that this was a good move — I'm not married to the idea of going back to school, but I did feel like making a change. We'll see where this goes.

1. I've shuffled my site around a bit. Created a new homepage, which isn't really fleshed out yet, and moved the blog posts to the area you're looking at now. There's still some work to do on it, if I have time. You can get back to the homepage by clicking the site title in the top left. Next step, ordering business cards (which I've already designed but have yet to order)!

1. My wife let me know yesterday that one of her co-workers is looking for a developer to take on a minor project. The company is a non-profit, so it may even be volunteer work, but I'd never turn down an opportunity to knock out a little project from scratch. We'll see how that goes.

1. Comments! Not yet, sorry. Still haven't gotten around to building a little comment server app, which is what I've been planning. Things have been incredibly busy this quarter. The last fiscal quarter is always a big time at work, and I've been cranking out business reports like nobodies business.

Looks like I fulfilled my New Year's Resolution so far. What did I give up for Lent? Apparently all of the time I wanted to spend on personal projects.
